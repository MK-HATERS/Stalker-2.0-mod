-﻿To the above mod authors thankyou for showing us the way! Thankyou GSC for making a fun game!!!!!!!-

Description:

﻿This is kind of a personal mod, i just want to share it though since i will be adding other additions to it. I would rather have a few paks instead of 20 or more. So my goal is to keep improving this with additions. I do not mind if you want to make adjustments to this, or reuse this for other purposes. ﻿To make it simple these edit a lot of .cfg's and i would suggest looking at original mods to see conflicts and have better understanding of what these do but you can always ask away.

Requirements:

        Mods listed are not "required", but make sure if used they are updated to current game version. And you are satisfied with any conflicts.

Install Notes: 

﻿1. Unpack archive in main directory (where Stalker2.exe is), make sure *.pak file lands in ~mods folder
﻿2. Make sure there's no conflict with other mods (zonepaq tool)
﻿3. Run Game
﻿4. Carry Weight Limit must be recalculated after loading the game for the first time:
﻿﻿- to trigger on an existing save unequip and equip your armor or artifact impacting the weight limit, even a Hercules will do the trick
